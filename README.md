# CNAPP Dashboard - Personalized by yashhh

## Project Overview
This project is a React-based dashboard application designed for cloud account monitoring and security assessments. It leverages modern web technologies and libraries to provide an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI (@mui/material, @mui/icons-material)**: For implementing Google's Material Design components.
- **Emotion (@emotion/react, @emotion/styled)**: For CSS-in-JS styling.
- **FontAwesome (@fortawesome/react-fontawesome, @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons)**: Icon library for UI icons.
- **Chart.js (chart.js, react-chartjs-2)**: For rendering interactive charts and data visualizations.
- **Testing Libraries (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event)**: For unit and integration testing of React components.
- **Node.js and npm**: For package management and running the development server.

## How to Run the Application Locally 

If you have the project files on your local computer (for example, copied via USB or downloaded as a ZIP), follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt** and navigate to the project directory where the files are located.

2. **Install Dependencies**
